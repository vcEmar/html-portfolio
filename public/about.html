<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my About Me page! I'm a college student who finds balance between two contrasting passions: gaming and ju-jitsu.</p>

<p>Gaming has been a lifelong love of mine, offering an escape into virtual worlds and challenging my strategic thinking. When I'm not gaming, I'm on the ju-jitsu mat, where I've discovered discipline, fitness, and personal growth.</p>

<p>Join me as I share my journey, experiences, and the exciting intersection of these two worlds that define my college life.</p>
